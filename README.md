# Fake News Detector
* Created a Fake News Detector to determine if a given news article is true or fake.
* The authenticity of an article is determined by three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Multinominal Naive Bayes, and SGD Classification.
* The models are trained on a Fake & Real news dataset.
* Once the authenticity of the article has been determined, it is displayed to the user via a Flask frontend.
* The application is hosted here: https://diego-fake-news.herokuapp.com/
